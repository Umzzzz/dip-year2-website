# A Website about A Study Of Sports In Manchester

In this project I had pleasure leading my successful team as project manager. This project was about sports in Manchester. 
Our main aim was to persuade students to joining sport clubs in Manchester. The way we met our aim was to build an interactive
website where students can access the website and find information about popular sports in Manchester. 
Not only I was project manager, I was also a content writer, making sure to write engaging content for our audience. I have given help and support through all the
stages in the project which included User Requirements, Reasearch, Website Development, Visual Production and User Testing. 

The web debvelopers in the project done a great job creating a website using Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. It 
was pleasure manging my developers to come up with a creative website. Even though I did not build the website, 
I still help through design phase with moodboards and wireframes. Finally I understand the technical side of this website which
is key as a project manager.
